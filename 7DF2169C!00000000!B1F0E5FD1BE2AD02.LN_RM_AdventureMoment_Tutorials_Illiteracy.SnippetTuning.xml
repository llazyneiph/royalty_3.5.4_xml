â€˜Practice Reading' (Adults) You can do this by self-clicking on your illiterate sim and choosing the practice reading interaction. 
Other sims with level 5 of the skill will be able to mentor them by clicking on them whilst the sim is performing the interaction. \n\n

'Practice Reading' (Children) You can buy 'Literacy Book' from any bookcase just like you can purchase homework. 
Kids are able to practice reading with this book and other sims with level 4 of the literacy skill can mentor them. 
They can also learn the skill at school. \n\n

Sims will gain a reward trait once they learn to read and can then teach others. 
Interactions like reading books, doing anything on a computer that requires reading, reading notices, ect will be greyed out from the pie menu until your sim reaches level 5 of the new Literacy skill.\n\n
This can be turned off in the settings menu.--></T>
