      <T n="text">0x0BCCA05E<!--Monarchs are your main focus in this mod, and you require a Monarch to use much of the mods features. \nMonarchs are responsible for bestowing the in-game traits to other sims, such as; Crown Royals, Nobles, Heirs, and more. \nThey work best when paired with another sim who has been given the ‘Royal Advisor’ trait.\nMonarchs also have a small career (a 10am-3pm rabbithole) available to only them, which can be found under the careers menu.\nThey also have a cute little custom plumbob with a crown, to make them feel really special!--></T>
