The tax collector, an old man named Reginald McCrook, will announce his arrival every Friday morning. Your sim will have an interaction (under the Royalty Mod pie menu) to pay their taxes. 
Taxes will cost them ยง100, and Reginald will take whatever money they have if they do not have the full amount!\n\n

The trader, Jacques, will come around a few times a week and your sims will have a chance to sell their crops, woodworking items and hunted meat to him. They will also be able to buy various things from Jacques. \n\n

Both Jaques and Reginald will spawn in medieval clothing.--></T>
